# AI-in-Smart-Grids-Reducing-Energy-Waste

Energy loss due to inefficiencies and theft is a major problem in developing economies. AI-powered smart grids and predictive analytics are now helping utilities reduce these losses.

    In Bihar, India, an AI-powered fraud detection system identified over 136 cases of electricity theft within a month (International Energy Agency, 2023), reducing non-technical losses that had previously drained resources from the energy sector.
    AI-powered microgrids in rural Africa use real-time demand forecasting to balance energy distribution, ensuring that stored solar energy is used efficiently without unnecessary wastage (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2024).

With AI, we are witnessing the rise of self-regulating energy systems that enhance both access and affordability of clean energy, paving the way for sustainable industrialization.
